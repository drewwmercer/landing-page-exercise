# landing-page-exercise  

A real-world client project posted on Upwork on 02-Sep-2021. Client requested an 'Entry level' freelancer and offered a pay range of $25.00-50.00 per hour.

We are looking for someone to create a website exactly like the one here except with the below design changes

Template To Start From:
https://www.webuyuglyhouses.com/los-angeles/wbuh1-sell-house-cash-fast/?utm_source=google_search&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=843006476&utm_term=sell%20my%20house%20quick&utm_content=464451123526&keyword=sell%20my%20house%20quick&gclid=Cj0KCQjw7MGJBhD-ARIsAMZ0eeuT3IlSBqeItG6udOHJf7OAtvnQFszcFE6RfAHJVfGknZ2ZlEGOfEIaAu3YEALw_wcB

Design Changes:

-Change the logo in the top left to the logo we give you
-Where it says "Get Cash for your Los Angeles house" change that to say "Get Cash For Your House Now"
-Change the button from "Get My Fair Cash Offer" to say "Get Cash Offer"
-When user starts typing in the address it will start to autopopulate addresses like it does now
-When user selects the "Get Cash Offer" (the old Get My Fair Cash Offer" Button) just make it do nothing for now (doesn't need to go to a next page)
-Remove the hero image and the caveman logo to the image we provide you
-Change all the green to a dark blue color that we will give you
-Wherever it say "We Buy Ugly Houses" in the wording change that to say "1 Day Close".  So for example it will say "The 1 Day Close Process is Fast & Easy" instead
-Should say "We can close in as little as 1 day after dilligence" instead of "We can close in as few as three weeks..."
-Remove the Covid-19 link at the top
-Replace the logo in the "Compare Your Options" matrix with the logo we give you
-In the yellow column it should say: 10 Years, Sometimes, Yes, No, Close in as little as 1 day
-In the footer where it says "AREAS WE SERVICE" for all the states they will not go to any other page they should just be un-clickable
Change where it says c2021 HomeVestors of America Inc. to "Arlington Capital Partners LLC"

Make the page hold and scroll with a "Get Cash Offer" Fill box at the top of the page (we will give you a different phone number to put here) like this: https://www.homevestors.com/   So go to that page and scroll down and do you see how the fill box follows down with the page?

Most of these are very simple design changes and all the other buttons and pages and links we do not need them to go anywhere, just this one landing page.
